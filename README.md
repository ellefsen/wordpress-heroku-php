## How to setup WordPress on Heroku with the Heroku Buildpack for PHP

This will set up a fresh WordPress install on Heroku with the newly released [Heroku Buildpack for PHP](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php).

* `nginx` - Nginx for serving web content.
* `PHP` - PHP-FPM for process management.
* `WordPress` - Downloaded from the Github WordPress Repo.
* `MySQL` - ClearDB for the MySQL backend.
* `Sendgrid` - Sendgrid for the email backend.
* `MemCachier` - MemCachier for the memcached backend.
* `New Relic`- Monitoring

## Getting started

Use the Deploy to Heroku button, or use the old fashioned way described below.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Old fashioned
Clone this repository into a new directory.

Create your Heroku app.

```bash
heroku apps:create application-name --stack cedar --buildpack https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php --region eu
```

`--region eu` is for deploying your app in the European region.

or on to add this buildpack to an existing app, run

```bash
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php
```


Before you push to Heroku make sure to add the following add-ons.

```bash
heroku addons:add cleardb
heroku addons:add sendgrid
heroku addons:add memcachier
heroku addons:add papertrail
heroku addons:add newrelic
```

Define your AWS keys for the AWS S3 Media Uploader plugin.

```bash
heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=123
heroku config:set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=123
```
Some default configurations. WP_CACHE=true will enable Batcache with the Memcachier addon.

```bash
heroku config:set DISABLE_WP_CRON=true
heroku config:set WP_CACHE=true
```

Deploy your WordPress site to Heroku.

```bash
git add .
git commit -am "Initial commit"
git push heroku master
```

    └── wp                 # Where the actual WordPress install will be installed by Composer
```

## Upgrade WordPress

Update the version number for the WordPress package in composer.json, then run `composer update` and commit the changes in composer.json and composer.lock. Do not upgrade WordPress from the admin-interface as it will not survive a restart or dyno change.

## Setup local development

Make sure you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed first, then run

```bash
composer install
```

Create a local `.env` file.

```bash
CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:123abc@127.0.0.1/my_wordpress_heroku_database_name
```

or install the heroku config plugin from https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-config and pull your environment variables from Heroku.
The second option is to use the provided local-sample-config.php and rename it local-config.php. Update it with your local MySQL credentials, and you're good to go.

> NOTE: If you don't have a command-line mysql accessible and working, Mac/Homebrew users can `brew install mysql` and then follow the directions to have launchd start mysql at login. I believe the default username is root and the default password is blank.

Install PHP 5.5 on Mac OS X with Homebrew if you don't already have it installed.

```bash
brew install --with-fpm php55
```

Follow the instructions in the output to complete the setup. Most importantly check your .bash_profile or .zshrc and make sure you've set your paths correctly.

```bash
brew install php55-mcrypt
brew install nginx
```

Open a new shell and run `php -v` and `php-fpm -v` and make sure they both read PHP 5.5… If you're still on PHP 5.4 then check your paths again. Make sure /usr/local/sbin is before /usr/sbin in your PATH:

> Mountain Lion comes with php-fpm pre-installed, to ensure you are using the brew version you need to make sure /usr/local/sbin is before /usr/sbin in your PATH:

```bash
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"
```

Add this below Heroku Toolbelt setting in .bashrc or .bash_profile to swap the PHP you use on the command line.

```bash
export PATH="$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php55)/bin:$PATH"
```

Now to start your local dev environment run to start WordPress on http://localhost:5000/

```bash
foreman start
```

If you don't have foreman installed, you can do so with `gem install foreman` assuming you have Ruby running on your system. If it fails, try adding sudo in front of the command.

## Known Issues

If you try to develop locally without syncing your external MemCachier envvars you might see a 500 error or a *You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page.* - message. Workaround is to simply remove object-cache.php and advanced-cache.php from the content dir while doing local dev. In a future release I'll try to have these files added on deploy with Composer.
